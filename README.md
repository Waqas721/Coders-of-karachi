# 📘 CodeBook Data Science Project – Pure Python Project 

This repository contains the complete solution for the **CodeBook Data Science Project**, where all tasks are performed using **pure Python** (no pandas, NumPy, or external libraries).

You will work with social network data, clean it, structure it, and implement intelligent recommendation features like **People You May Know** and **Pages You May Like**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project includes:

- Loading and exploring JSON data  
- Cleaning messy and inconsistent user/page records  
- Structuring data for analysis  
- Implementing social media features using only Python:
  - ✔ People You May Know  
  - ✔ Pages You May Like

| `data2.json` | Raw dataset containing users and pages with missing values|
| `01_Introduction.ipynb` | Loads and prints data in a readable format |
| `02_Data_Cleaning.ipynb` | Cleans and structures the raw dataset |
| `cleaned_data2.json` | Cleaned dataset generated by `02_Data_Cleaning.ipynb`|
| `people_you_may_know.py` | Suggests friends based on mutual connections |
| `pages_you_may_like.py` | Suggests pages the user may like |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## 🧩 Task Breakdown

### **1️⃣ Load & Display the Data**
- Reads JSON using Python's built-in `json` module  
- Prints users, friends, and liked pages  
- Displays all available pages  

✔ Done using pure Python.

---

### **2️⃣ Clean & Structure the Data**

The dataset contains issues like:
- Missing user names  
- Duplicate friend entries  
- Users with no activity  
- Duplicate page IDs  

### ✔ Cleaning Steps
- Remove users with empty names  
- Deduplicate friend lists  
- Remove inactive users  
- Remove duplicate pages by ID  

---

### **3️⃣ People You May Know**

A recommendation system using **mutual friends**.

#### ✔ Logic:
- If two users share mutual friends but are not connected → Recommend  
- More mutual friends → Higher priority  

Example Output:
People You May Know for User 1: [4]


---

### **4️⃣ Pages You May Like**

Recommends pages based on:
- Pages liked by your friends  
- Pages liked by people with similar interests  
- Excludes pages already liked  

Example Output:

Pages You May Like for User 2: ['AI & ML Community', 'Python Developers']
